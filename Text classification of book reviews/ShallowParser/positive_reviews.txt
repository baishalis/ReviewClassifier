Such a well written book, great story that draws you in and doesn't let you go until the end! Would definitely read again
This book is firmly positioned in my top 10 best reads ever. A truly wonderful book.
All in all, a very good book. This one is good, though it never really talks about or explains the title .
I loved it. Don't let the subject matter distract you from a great novel. Great.
A very worthwhile read and a story that will stick with me forever. Fascinating and easy to read.
The perfect ending in any book I have read in a loing time. I must say I adore this book. Best book in a long time.
I found the parts that I read pornographic and vulgar. I should just stick to the young adult novels. this book is dissapointing.
The subject is very confusing and a bad change from crime novels. And I also found the writing very thin and informal.
The writing is very dull and boring.  Didn't live up to my expectations. It was not worth reading.
This book was not at all what I was expecting. this book is little confusing and very long. Not at all what I expected.
I enjoyed the movie more, since the book is very long and boring to read. Never judge a book by it's cover. I didn't like this book .
