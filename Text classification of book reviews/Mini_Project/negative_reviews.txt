I read this about a year ago and can't recall a great deal of the book. From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper.Eloquent.

don't not no don't not no don't not no hate irritating 
The quality of the paper, print, and cover was so poor that I was embarrassed to give it as a gift.  What a shame.Disappointing.

I don't love this book.

I found the parts that I read pornographic and vulgar.I should just stick to the young adult novels. dissapointing.

The subject is very confusing and a bad change from crime novels. And I also found the writing very thin and informal.

The writing is very dull and boring. Didn't live up to my expectations. Not worth reading.

This book was not at all what I was expecting. this book is little confusing and very long .Not at all what I expected.

I enjoyed the movie more, since the book is very long and boring to read. never judge a book by it's cover. I didn't like this book .

There was a slow start toward the beginning. And towards the end it got even more slow and boring . i won't recommend this book to anyone to read.

this book was horrible.  The characters were flat, the story was unengaging. the writing is so bad. 

I read this book after my friend suggested me, but it was soo bad and not at all as i had expected it to be . It is very long and boring book to read . The contents are not rich and is terrible.

I didn't like the story line and the lanuguage and sexual content. It was much too graphic for me. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Didn't like it.

Just when you stop grimacing from one unbelievable gorey tragedy and don't think it can get much worse, it does.  Violence, murders, foul language, adultery, gore, and animal cruelty dominate.  It was creepy.

This book had a good story line, but the language and sexual content was more than I like. Not for kids.

It took me a good 4 days to get halfway through this book before it finally caught my attention. It was okay, I wasnt drawn in immediately. i completely disliked this book. 

There was a lot of sexual language that didn't add to the story at all. It just had a lot more sexual content than I want to read.Inappropriate language.

I didn't see the movie and after reading the book, I wonder how it became a movie.I thought it was a ver slow read, just didn't capture my interest enough.Was not impressed.

The prose was uninspiring.  Most of the characters were not believable.  If books were as wines, I'd rate this an average. 

I was really disappointed by this book. But the circus stuff was very pedestrian. No spark to the writing. Don't waste your time. This is a pointless stroy to read.
